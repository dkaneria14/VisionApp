# VisionApp\
Hey guys WELCOME!!

In this application i incorporated google vision framework and and API that converts image to text!
The main objective of this project is that if i want to know a defination of a word and i dont wanna type,
i would just take a pic of the word and this app would convert it to text and tell you the defination of that word using the dictionary API. 

//Current progress:
I am able to pick an image from the phone gallery and able to convert it to text.
I have incorporated dictionary API now on my app! Now i am able to get the definition of that converted text!

Next Step: 
Learning Machine Learning to help identify texts when we switch the camera on. So instead of picking an image from the gallery, i want to select the text through the camera of my phone and pop up a definition there
