# VisionApp\
Hey guys WELCOME!!

In this application i incorporated google vision framework and and API that converts image to text!
The main objective of this project is that if i want to know a defination of a word and i dont wanna type,
i would just take a pic of the word and this app would convert it to text and tell you the defination of that word using the dictionary API. 

//Current progress:
I am able to pick an image from the phone gallery and able to convert it to text.
So the next step will be incorporating the dictionary API.
